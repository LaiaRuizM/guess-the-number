# GUESS THE NUMBER | LaiaRuizM

- Hi there people! 👋🏻
- My name is Laia Ruiz Martínez and this a JavaScript's project called **guess the number**.

## -- About this project 📋🙋🏼‍♀️ --

- I have developed a website with a "Guess the Number" game. Upon entering the page, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides clues on whether the number they try is too high or too low, and keeps track of the number of attempts. Until finally the player guesses the number correctly. Welcome on board!

## Additional information

### What can I find in this exercise?

> **NOTE:** In this exercise, you can find the following files and folders:

1. The folder 📂 `src/` contains the files for this website: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and images.
1. The folders 📚 `public/` and `docs/` are automatically generated when we start the project. GULP reads the files in the src/ folder, processes them, and then generates them inside the `public/` and `docs/` folders.
1. The individual files 📝 that are loose in the repository root, such as gulpfile.js, package.json... are the project configuration files and we do not need to modify them.

### How can I start from scratch?

> **NOTE:** Below are the steps to follow:

1. **Make sure you have Node JS installed / install it** to work with the Starter Kit.
1. **Create your own repository**. NOTE: Be very aware of the folder where you are at all times.
1. Download the **Adalab Starter Kit from GitHub**.
   - As a recommendation: Avoid cloning the repo, because if you do, you won't be able to add commits.
1. **Copy all the files** from the Starter kit to the root folder of your repository.
   - Remember to copy also the **hidden files** (IMPORTANT!)
   - If you decide to clone the repo, avoid copying the `.git` folder. Because, if you do, you will be overwriting your own repository.
1. **Open a terminal** in the **root** folder of your repository.
1. **Install the local dependencies** by executing the command in the terminal:

```bash
   npm install
```

### How can I run the project?

> **NOTE:** The project must be started every time you start programming.

- To start it, run the command:

```bash
npm start
```

**What does this command do?**

- **Opens a Chrome window and shows your web page**. It is the same as the VS Code Live Server plugin (Go live).
- Additionally, **observes** all the files inside the `src/` folder. Every time you modify a file, **refresh your page in Chrome**.
- It also **processes** the HTML, SASS/CSS, and JS **files** and **generates and saves them in the `public/` folder**. For example:
  - Converts the SASS files to CSS.
  - Combines the different HTML files and groups them into one or several HTML files.

After running `npm start`, you can start editing all the files inside the `src/` folder and programming.

### How can I publish the project on GitHub Pages?

To generate your page for production, run the command:

```bash
npm run docs
```

Then:

1. In the explorer, a folder named `docs/` will have been created. If it does not appear at first, refresh!
2. In the terminal, type git add -A, git commit -m "run docs" and git push.
3. Go to the `settings` tab of your repo -> "code and automation" -> in the GitHub Pages section, activate the **master branch /docs folder** option -> save -> refresh. (IMPORTANT!).
4. It may take a while to create it, due to the deployment. Once the URL has been generated, you can send it.
5. As a recommendation: Add this URL on the main page of the project, in the ABOUT section.
